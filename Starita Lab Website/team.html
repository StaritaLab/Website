				Between applying high throughput techniques to mutational scanning assays and keeping the lab organized, Nahum supports both the Saturation Genome Editing team and Lea’s academic trainees.<br><br>
				Enthusiastic about baking desserts and building customized keyboards, Nahum can often be found describing his newest cookie adaption or preaching about ergonomics. <br><br>
				Nahum cares deeply about making science easier for everyone, whether that’s brewing the day’s second pot of coffee or being recruited for a cloning project – some claim he’s the E. coli equivalent of a ‘green thumb’.

			<p>A graduate of the University of Washington, Jordan earned her BS in Biology while also pursuing pre-med. Working for several years in medical scribing cultured her interests in pathology and the public’s knowledge of medicine (or lack thereof), which led her to start her research career just as the COVID-19 pandemic began. She now does everything from sample intake to PCR; she additionally wrangles staff, manages space and inventory, and despairs over trying to fit so many freezers in the lab. She often uses the glass on her biohazard hood to practice her drawing and write ideas for new cocktails based on characters in her favorite media.</p>

			<p>Ana recently graduated from Stony Brook University with a BS in Biology and a minor in studio art. By day, she utilizes her biology degree as the quality control queen - if your samples are degraded, she will not let you pass onto a sci-production run. By night, her art minor comes in handy in crocheting, which she does while enjoying some reality TV with her cat.</p>
